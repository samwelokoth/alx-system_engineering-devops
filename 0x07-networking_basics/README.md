## Introduction

Networking is the practice of connecting computers and other devices to share resources and information. Understanding networking basics is crucial for anyone involved in IT or software development.

## Key Concepts

- **Network**: A collection of connected devices that can communicate with each other.
- **Protocol**: A set of rules governing communication between devices.
- **Router**: A device that connects different networks and directs data between them.
- **Switch**: A device that connects devices within the same network.
- **Gateway**: A node in a network that serves as an entry point to another network.

## Networking Layers

Understanding the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is essential to comprehend the different layers involved in networking:

1. **Physical Layer**
2. **Data Link Layer**
3. **Network Layer**
4. **Transport Layer**
5. **Session Layer**
6. **Presentation Layer**
7. **Application Layer**

## Common Protocols

- **TCP/IP**: The fundamental suite of protocols for the Internet.
- **HTTP/HTTPS**: Protocols for web communication.
- **DNS**: Resolves domain names to IP addresses.
- **FTP**: File Transfer Protocol for file sharing.

## IP Addressing

- **IPv4 vs. IPv6**: Understanding the differences and advantages.
- **Subnetting**: Dividing IP networks for efficient resource management.

## Routing

- **Routing Tables**: How routers determine the best path for data.
- **Static vs. Dynamic Routing**: Configuring routes manually or automatically.

## Network Security

- **Firewalls**: Protecting networks by controlling incoming and outgoing traffic.
- **Encryption**: Securing data transmission through encryption protocols.
- **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**: Monitoring and detecting suspicious activities.
